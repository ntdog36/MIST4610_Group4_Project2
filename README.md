## Our Data Set
Monthly and Annual Energy Consumption by Sector

It contains columns corresponding to the following items:
- Month/Year (1973-2024) 
- Total Fossil Fuels Production
- Nuclear Electric Power Production 
- Total Renewable Energy Production
- Total Primary Energy Production
- Primary Energy Imports
- Primary Energy Exports
- Primary Energy Net Imports
- Primary Energy Stock Change and Other
- Total Fossil Fuels Consumption
- Nuclear Electric Power Consumption
- Total Renewable Energy Consumption
- Total Primary Energy Consumption

## Importance of Our Selected Data Set
- Climate change
- Sustainability
- Limited resources such as fossil fuels  
- Shows progress toward goals
- Renewable vs non-renewable energy
- Drives future decisions
- Affects public health

## Question 1
### Which month experiences the highest/lowest rate of consumption by energy source?

*This question is important because it helps us understand…*

- At what point is the energy grid used most?
- At what point is the energy grid used the least?
- How do renewables different from traditional sources in month by month consumption. 
- Help understand which months will experience the highest and lowest energy costs.
- These results would provides actionable insights for grid designers that could improve reliability and support planning/investment.

Summary(High/Low):
- Fossil Fuels: January/September
- Nuclear Power: January/April
- Renewables: May/September

Trends: January seems to be the highest consumption rate, while September has the lowest. 

This means that Grid Operators need to build their gird to withstand the high demands of January.

High energy usage industries like AI should use the September lows to reduce costs.

Renewables usage peaks in the summer months which shows the importance of solar panel to that industry. 

## Question 2
### What is the predicted percentage of each energy consumption type out of total energy consumption in the next 10 years?

*This questions is important because it helps us understand…*

- How the energy mix will look in the next decade
- Identify which energy types are expected to increase/decrease
- Reveal how dependent we are on non-renewable energy sources 
- Highlight future investment needs in renewable energy infrastructure or energy storage
- These results would provide actionable insights that guide policy, sustainability goals, and long-term energy planning
